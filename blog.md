# U.S. Colleges and Graduation Rates

### An analysis of 1,000 U.S. colleges graduation rates.

## Introduction

The purpose of this blog is to show an in depth analysis of the affects on graduations rates in U.S. colleges. The analysis studies 1,000 colleges with information on student size, tuition prices, diversity, region, and graduation rates. Studying this information could be useful in determining what factors help students graduate. Those inquiring about a future college career could use the information in deciding where to attend school.

Education is crucial for societal purposes. Education allows people to become evolved thinkers and be active participants in society, and the economy. Learning what factors help students graduate could help increase overall graduation rates. While this analysis does give some insight on what influences graduation rates, this information should not be used and cited as this is not an offical analysis.

## Motivation

From this analysis it is my hope that I learn more about the data cleaning process and analysis. I am hoping to gain a better understanding of demographics from different colleges across the nation.

## Ethical Data Practices

Data gathered from the U.S. Census Bureau and College Scorecard is allowed because it is public data. Anyone can acess the data as long as they are not used to identify any individual person, household, business or other entity. The Bureau also requests that the following disclaimer be made: "This product uses the Census Bureau Data API but is not endorsed or certified by the Census Bureau." 

Using these guidelines I wwas able to determine that use of this data for the purpose of my research question was ethical. I aquired API keys specifically assigned to myself and these keys were not published and cannot be accessed via the cleaning process and exploratory data analysis. 

## A Short Note on Acquiring the Data

This analysis uses one datasets that has been cleaned and merged from two datasets, one with information about colleges, the other about state population. 

The <a href="https://www.census.gov/data/developers/data-sets.html">U.S. Census Bureau</a> and <a href="https://collegescorecard.ed.gov/data/api-documentation">College Scorecard</a> have in depth information about downloading data, acquiring and use of APIs and keys. To get started follow the instructions on those sites. Once you have the two different datasets, clean them and merge to get one dataframe that includes the following columns:

- Student_Size
- Tuition_In_State
- Tuition_Out_State
- Female_Share
- Race_White
- Race_Black
- Race_Hispanic
- Race_Asian
- Race_AIAN
- Race_NHPI
- Race_Two_Or_More
- Grad_Rate
