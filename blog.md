# U.S. Colleges and Graduation Rates

### An analysis of 1,000 U.S. colleges graduation rates.

## Introduction

The purpose of this blog is to show an in depth analysis of the affects on graduations rates in U.S. colleges. The analysis studies 1,000 colleges with information on student size, tuition prices, diversity, region, and graduation rates. Studying this information could be useful in determining what factors help students graduate. Those inquiring about a future college career could use the information in deciding where to attend school.

Education is crucial for societal purposes. Education allows people to become evolved thinkers and be active participants in society, and the economy. Learning what factors help students graduate could help increase overall graduation rates. While this analysis does give some insight on what influences graduation rates, this information should not be used and cited as this is not an offical analysis.

## Motivation

From this analysis it is my hope that I learn more about the data cleaning process and analysis. I am hoping to gain a better understanding of demographics from different colleges across the nation.
